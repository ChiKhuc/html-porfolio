<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Chi. I am Vietnamese and currently living in Malaysia. I am working as a Lodging  Associate at a Online Travel Agency.</p>

<p>I like my job as it provides me with comfort; however, lately, I’ve been feeling that I am in my comfort zone and need to keep learning.</p>

<p>I believe that to live is to learn, and that’s why I want to become a Web Developer, a career that requires continuous learning since technology is changing every day.</p>
